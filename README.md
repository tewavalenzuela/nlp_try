# Description 

In this mini project i found text to analyze (in my case - Formula One article), then preprocessed it for analysis. By tokenizing i conveniently split up text by word, which allowed me to work with smaller pieces of text that are still relatively coherent and meaningful even outside of the context of the rest of the text. At the following steps i filtered stop words and then circled back to stemming and lemmatizing. With a frequency distribution i checked which words showed up most frequently in my text and turned it into a graph. Last step was creating bag of words. Bag of words is a method to extract features from text documents. These features can be used for training machine learning algorithms. It creates a vocabulary of all the unique words occurring in all the documents in the training set. In simple terms, itâ€™s a collection of words to represent a sentence with word count and mostly disregarding the order in which they appear.
